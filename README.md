
## Project Overview

This project explores thermal diffusion on fractal surfaces, focusing on the Mandelbrot set and Sierpinski triangle (and other simple shapes). The aim is to numerically simulate and analyze how heat propagates across these complex geometries, which are relevant in various physical and astronomical contexts.

## Structure

- **src/**: Contains core Python classes and functions for simulations and fractal generation.
- **project.ipynb**: Main Jupyter notebook demonstrating simulations, results, and visualizations.
- **alternative_open_section.ipynb**: Additional analysis based on circumference.
- **.py files**: Exported versions of the notebooks, containing only code as per submission requirements.

## Features

- Simulation of heat diffusion using numerical methods (e.g., finite difference).
- Generation and visualization of fractal surfaces.
- Comparative analysis of diffusion on regular vs. fractal geometries.


## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required dependencies (see `requirements.txt` if available).
3. Run the notebooks for interactive exploration, or execute the `.py` files for code-only runs.
